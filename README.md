It is CCO licence, so you can use it as you please

you can use it from cdn or you can download it, (I did both but at the end I'm loading it from public folder)

There are alo other options you can choose, like coping code (component (Scene graph))

# `@use-gesture`, `touch-action` problem (Mobile problem)

Just add `toucg-action: none` to CSS, on `canvas` selector

Without this dragging will have bug on mobile, and also you will have warning in console on desktop
